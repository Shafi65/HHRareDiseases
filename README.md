## **Overview**
**NIQ-Gene** is a **networking interactive website** designed to facilitate the prediction of gene-disease mechanisms. Through a customizable **questionnaire**, users can evaluate a gene of interest and predict one of the three primary mechanisms:

- **Gain of Function (GOF)**
- **Loss of Function (LOF)**
- **Dominant Negative (DN)**

---

## **Target Audience**
This tool is best suited for:
- **Physicians**
- **Researchers**
- **Geneticists & Biologists**

Users can submit their collected data to **ClinGen** for further validation by expert panels, ensuring scientific accuracy and real-world applicability.

---

## **Why NIQ-Gene?**
With the **vast amount of genetic datasets and literature available online**, it is often **time-consuming** and **overwhelming** to analyze and conclude the most likely gene-disease mechanism, especially for those without a specialization in clinical genetics.

### **Key Benefits:**
- **Quick Identification**: Helps users distinguish among the three primary gene-disease mechanisms efficiently.
- **Networking Feature**: Connects users researching the same gene, fostering collaboration and validation.
- **Data Contribution**: Expands the available dataset for gene-disease mechanisms through user contributions.

---

## **How It Works**
The questionnaire consists of multiple-choice questions focusing on key distinguishing features, such as:
- **Mutation Type**
- **Impact on Protein Function**
- **Changes in Spatial & Temporal Expression**
- **Inheritance Pattern**
- **Protein Structure (Single or Multi-Subunit)**

### **Scoring System**
Each answer is assigned a score (-1, 0, 1). These scores are:
- **Mathematically normalized** into a **0-10** scale for each mechanism (**GOF, LOF, DN**).
- **Displayed in real-time**, allowing users to modify their answers and observe the impact.

### **Networking and Data Storage**
- User responses are stored in a **MongoDB database** in **JSON format**.
- New users can view **previous responses** to see patterns in gene-disease associations.

---

## **Tech Stack & Computational Strength**
- **Frontend**: [React.js](https://react.dev/) with **Material-UI (MUI)** for a seamless and intuitive user experience.
- **Backend**: [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for request processing and structured scoring.
- **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for scalable and efficient data storage.
- **Scalability**: Designed to support a **global user base**, adaptable for research and clinical use.
